<p>I studied film in college. I studied film because I liked to read big long books about movies and the people who made them. 
  Ostensibly, <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/how-neo-is-angling-for-a-piece-of-the-multibillion-dollar-film-production-industry" target="_blank">I loved movies</a>
 and the adrenaline rush of being on set. 
I studied film at Cleveland State University, in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio.
It was called an “urban campus” because it was right on the street in the middle of the city.
People could just walk right by it. The film school was blocks away from campus, in the Idea Building under the big chandelier at Playhouse Square. 
In 2018, Cleveland was considered a big up and coming film city, potentially on par with Austin, Chicago, or Atlanta. 
As a freshman I interviewed the film school’s director, who was brand new to the school at the same time as I was, about his innovative new formula to turn us into a filmmaking force to be reckoned with, on par with Austin, Chicago, or Atlanta.

Over the course of four years, I learned that I did not want to make films, or to help people make films, at least not now, and not in Cleveland.
I had always loved to read books and watch movies, but I hated homework. This turned out to be a problem in undergrad, when my homework was to read books and watch movies. After Covid, I stopped seriously studying film. I started reading books again. I started enjoying movies again. My film cohort assumed that I had dropped out, but I was just working in the library, taking English classes, and volunteering at the Cinematheque.
