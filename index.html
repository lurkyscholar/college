<p>I studied film in college. I studied film because I liked to read big long books about movies and the people who made them. Ostensibly, I loved movies and the adrenaline rush of being on set. 
I studied film at Cleveland State University, in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio.

<p>It was called an “urban campus” because it was right on the street in the middle of the city.
People could just walk right by it.

<p>The film school was blocks away from campus, in the Idea Building under the big chandelier at Playhouse Square. In 2018, Cleveland was considered a big up and coming film city, potentially on par with Austin, New Mexico, Chicago, or Atlanta. As a freshman I interviewed the film school’s director, who was brand new to the school at the same time as I was, about his innovative new formula to turn us into a filmmaking force to be reckoned with, on par with Austin, New Mexico, Chicago, or Atlanta.

<p> Over the course of four years, I learned that I did not want to make films, or to help people make films, at least not now, and not in Cleveland.

<p> I had always loved to read books and watch movies, but I hated homework. This turned out to be a problem in undergrad, when my homework was to read books and watch movies. After Covid, I stopped seriously studying film. My film cohort assumed that I had dropped out, but I was just working in the library, taking English classes, and volunteering at the Cinematheque.
